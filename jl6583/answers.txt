#Justification of calculations in question 3:
The overall trend of the grading of a restaurant over time can be calculated by simple linear regression. 
The first step is converting the grading system to numerical, we did this by assigning A=2,B=1,C=0,
therefore, technically, we will get a line for each grading sequence, the overall grade is improving if the slope of the line
is positive and declining if the slope is negative. The grading remains unchanged if the slope is 0.
However in realization there are very few sequences that regressed to a strictly 0-slope line, to solve the problem,
we adopted the concept of stationary series in time series processing theory, by running an ADF hypothesis test we can 
find if a series is overall stationary (which means does not have a general trend that is improving or declining), for series
that are not stationary we then calculate the linear regression to determine the overall trend

#What other information can you find in this data?
One of the facts that we could unveil from this data is the general trend of number of inspections over time, 
we generated a plot showing the frequency of inspections each week over the years, and found that the restaurant inspections
started to boost after 2010 and after the 4th quarter of 2011 the number of inspections per week fluctuates around 1000 to 1500,
and this number started to decrease again by the Q3 of 2014

#Is the data useful for assessing the qualities of restaurants?
Generally speaking this data is useful because it gives you at least an glimpse at the overall grading of the restaurants (e.g. that
most restaurants had acceptable qualities under the grading system in all of the 5 boroughs), however the data set does not provide
the information in detailed concerned with the grading system and the coverage of the inspection, which means that data would probably be
biased and thus not a reliable way to assess the qualities.
